 Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description                                                                                                                                 | Example |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `+`      | Adds two operands                                                                                                                           | `A + B` will give `30` |
| `-`      | Subtracts second operand from the first                                                                                                     | `A - B` will give `-10`|
| `*`      | Multiplies both operands                                                                                                                    | `A * B` will give `200`|
| `/`      | Divides numerator by denominator                                                                                                            | `B / A` will give `2`  |
| `%`      | Modulus operator and returns remainder after division                                                                                       | `B % A` will give `0`  |
| `++`     | [Increment operator in C++](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_increment_decrement_operators.htm): increases integer value by one | `A++` will give `11`   |
| `--`     | [Decrement operator in C++](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_increment_decrement_operators.htm): decreases integer value by one | `A--` will give `9`    |

## Relational Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                      | Example              |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `==`     | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then condition becomes true.     | `(A == B)` is true.  |
| `!=`     | Checks if the values of two operands are not equal. If yes, then condition becomes true.        | `(A != B)` is true.  |
| `>`      | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, true.   | `(A > B)` is true.   |
| `<`      | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, true.      | `(A < B)` is true.   |
| `>=`     | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand.     | `(A >= B)` is true.  |
| `<=`     | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand.        | `(A <= B)` is true.  |

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                                  | Example               |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `&&`     | Called Logical AND operator. If **both** operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.                  | `(A && B)` is true.   |
| `||`     | Called Logical OR operator. If **any** of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.          | `(A || B)` is true.   |
| `!`      | Called Logical NOT operator. Reverses the logical state of its operand. If condition is true, makes it false. | `!(A && B)` is true.  |
